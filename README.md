# nf-rnaseq-bacteria

This repository presents a computational workflow to compute and characterize all iModulons for a selected organism. This occurs in five steps:
1. Gather all publicly available RNA-seq data for the organism ([Step 1](asdf))
2. Process the RNA-seq data ([Step 2](asdf))
3. Inspect data to identify high-quality datasets ([Step 3](asdf))
4. Compute iModulons ([Step 4](asdf))
5. Characterize iModulons using [PyModulon](pymodulon link) ([Step 5](asdf))

## Background
An **iModulon** is xyz. 

## Setup

Pre-requisite software is listed within each step of the workflow. In addition, we have provided pre-built Docker containers with all necessary software.

To begin, install [Docker] and [Nextflow].

## Tutorial

A step-by-step tutorial to compute the Modulome for *Bacillus subtilis* is outlined [here](https://pymodulon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), and can also be found in the README files for each step.
